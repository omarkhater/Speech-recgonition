# Speech-recgonition
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules have proved indispensability in any Natural Lanugage Processing solution. 
A deep learning powered automatic speech recognition system ,that accepts raw audio as an input and returns the predicted transcription of the spoken language, 
is designed in this project.

# Models and Training 
4 Different configurable Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that could be Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells have been developed. 
In addition, 2 different CNN-RNN archetictures have been designed which surpassed pure RNN architctures. Finally, All models trained using single GPU.
# Data 
The data set used in the project is provided by [LibriSpeech](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf)
